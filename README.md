## Introduction
Mod for Dyson Sphere Program to make the ray receiver be able to request more power.
For now, it doesn't trigger the abnormality check, meaning achievements will not be disabled.
Default multiplier value is 10x, see below for configuration.
## Configuration
![statistics](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Rokumaehn/MegaRayReceiver/refs/heads/main/img/statistics.png)
The multiplier can be configured in-game via the power tab of the statistics panel. Changes are applied on-the-fly, so if the value is changed in the panel, this will directly affect all ray receivers in the game.
